# ChessGame

Objectives:

1 - Work with OPP concepts (Inheritance / Polimorphism / Abastraction).

2 - Work with layer development.

About the system:

The board is but a simple 8x8 matrix.
There are 2 lists for the pieces, one for the pieces that are currently on the board, and another for the pieces that have been captured.

OBS:

1 - There are 2 types of Position on this project, a Matrix Position, and a Chess position. The application is not allowed to have direct access to the Matrix Position. The access to the position need to be made by providing the column char, and the row int (eg: a1, b2)
